# Natural Object Dataset (NOD) fMRI RDM Analysis

This repository contains scripts and tools for analyzing the Natural Object Dataset (NOD) fMRI data, with a focus on generating and comparing Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) across subjects and brain regions.

---

## Repository Structure

- **scripts/**
  - `create_subject_roi_rdms.py`  
    Generates RDMs for each subject and region of interest (ROI) using beta weights from fMRI data. Outputs are saved as `.npy` vectors per subject/region.
  - `analyze_subject_rdms.py`  
    Loads subject-level RDMs and computes region-by-region similarity matrices. Produces heatmaps and MDS plots for visualization.
  - `analyze_intersubject_regions.py`  
    Computes and visualizes intersubject similarity matrices for each ROI, including histograms of intersubject distances and region-by-region RDM comparisons.
  - `__pycache__/`  
    Python bytecode cache (can be ignored).

- **outputs/**
  - `sub-XX/`  
    Per-subject output folders containing RDM vectors and filenames.
  - `intersubject-histograms/`  
    Histograms of intersubject distances for each region.
  - `intersubject-RDMs/`  
    Intersubject similarity matrices and region-by-region RDMs.

## Main Scripts and Their Usage

### 1. `create_subject_roi_rdms.py`

**Purpose:**  
Creates RDMs for each subject and ROI using beta weights from preprocessed fMRI data.

**Key Features:**
- Loads beta weights and labels for each subject, session, and run.
- Extracts ROI-specific activations using anatomical masks.
- Computes RDMs (default: cosine distance) for each ROI.
- Saves RDMs as flattened vectors (`.npy`) and corresponding filenames.

**Usage:**
```sh
python [create_subject_roi_rdms.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) --data_dir <BIDS_data_dir> --output_dir <output_dir> --task <task_name>
